# pi@raspberrypi:~ $ vcgencmd get_throttled
#  0: under-voltage
#  1: arm frequency capped
#  2: currently throttled
# 16: under-voltage has occurred
# 17: arm frequency capped has occurred
# 18: throttling has occurred

 #  0: under-voltage (0xX0001)
 #  1: arm frequency capped (0xX0002 or 0xX0003 with under-voltage)
 #  2: currently throttled (0xX0004 or 0xX0005 with under-voltage)

 # 16: under-voltage has occurred (0x1000X)
 # 17: arm frequency capped has occurred (0x2000X or 0x3000X also under-voltage
 #     occurred)
 # 18: throttling has occurred (0x4000X or 0x5000X also under-voltage occurred)

 # under-voltage occurs when voltage drops below 4.63V. The Raspberry Pi is 
 #   throttled
 # arm frequency capped occurs with temp > 80'C
 # over-temperature occurs with temp > 85'C. The Raspberry Pi is throttled

 # Throttling removes turbo mode, which reduces core voltage, and sets arm and 
 #  gpu frequencies to non-turbo value.
 # Capping just limits the arm frequency (somewhere between 600MHz and 1200MHz)
 #  to try to avoid throttling.
 # If you are throttled and not under-voltage then you can assume 
 #  over-temperature. (confirm with vcgencmd measure_temp).
