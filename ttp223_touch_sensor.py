"""
S185 - Introduction to Single-Board Computers

A Python GPIO interface script file for the TTP223 Digital Touch Sensor Module.

This version of the Python script will only print while the sensor is being
touched.

Execution:
1. Set the executable flag on the script: chmod u+x ttp223_touch_sensor.py
2. Execute with a preceding dot "./", so call ./ttp223_touch_sensor.py
