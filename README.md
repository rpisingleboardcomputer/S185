Introduction to Single-Board Computers

A single-board computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, with microprocessor(s), 
memory, input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board computers were made 
as demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as embedded computer controllers. 
Many types of home computers or portable computers integrate all their functions onto a single printed circuit board. 

Unlike a desktop personal computer, single board computers often do not rely on expansion slots for peripheral 
functions or expansion. Single board computers have been built using a wide range of microprocessors. Simple designs,
such as those built by computer hobbyists, often use static RAM and low-cost 8 or 16 bit processors. Other types, 
such as blade servers, would perform similar to a server computer, only in a more compact format.
