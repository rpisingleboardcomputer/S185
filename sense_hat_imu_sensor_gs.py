S185 - Introduction to Single-Board Computers

Read data from the IMU sensor on the Sense HAT.  This sensor is
considered to be a 9-DOF (degrees of freedom) sensor.
 - Gyroscope
 - Accelerometer
 - Magnetometer (compass)

Execution:
1. Set the executable flag on the script: chmod u+x sense_hat_imu_sensor_gs.py
2. Execute with a preceding dot "./", so call ./sense_hat_imu_sensor_gs.py
